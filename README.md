This project presents a structured exploratory data analysis of a travel booking dataset on jupyter notebook, conducted to understand booking distribution, customer behavior 
patterns, and reservation dynamics across multiple business dimensions. The analysis 
focuses on transforming raw transactional booking data into visually interpretable insights for stakeholders and managers. 
Data preprocessing steps were performed to ensure analytical consistency, including 
handling missing values, standardizing categorical variables, and deriving time-based 
features such as booking month and day of the week. These transformations enabled multilevel temporal analysis. 

Exploratory analysis was carried out across key dimensions such as city, property, booking 
channel, room type, and star rating. Aggregations and comparative visualizations were 
developed to identify booking concentration patterns and performance variations.
